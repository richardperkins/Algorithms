# Data Structures
This article lists some basic data structures, examples, and use cases.

## Permutation
**Permutations** are arrangements of items.

### Example

```[3,1,0,2]``` is a permutation of ```[0,1,2,3]```.

### Application
Use when problem seeks:
* Arrangement
* Tour
* Ordering
* Sequence


## Subset
**Subsets** are selections from a set.
### Example
```
[2,3]
```
### Note
Ordering does not matter with subsets. ```[3,2]``` is considered identical to ```[2,3]```. 

### Application
Use when problem seeks:
* Cluster
* Collection
* Committee
* Group
* Packaging


## Tree
**Trees** represent heirarchial relationships between items.

### Application
Use when problem seeks:
* hierarchy
* dominance relationship
* ancestor/descendant relationship
* taxonomy

## Graph
**Graphs** represent relationships between arbitrary pairs of objects.

### Application
Use when problem seeks:
* Network
* Circuit
* Web
* Relationship

## Point
**Points** represent locations in geometric space. 

### Application
Use when problem works on:
* Sites
* Positions
* Records

## Polygon
**Polygons** represent regions in geometric space.

### Application
Use when working on:
* Shapes
* Regions
* Configurations
* Boundaries
